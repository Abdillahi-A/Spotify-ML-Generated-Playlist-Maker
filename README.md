# Spotify-ML-Generated-Playlist-Maker

## About:
This project uses unsupervised learning learning (K-means Clustering) to organise my favourite tunes into four ML generated playlists based on song attributes such as danceability, valance, energy and more.

This project is divided into 3 parts.

## Part 1: Data Exploration
This part starts bt loading my listening data over the past year and performing some exploaratory data analysis in order to get a feel of my listening habbits and learn some insights into my music taste e.g.
